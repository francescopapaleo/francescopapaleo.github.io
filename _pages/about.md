I started my journey as a sound engineer and have been working in the music industry for over 15 years, touring the world and working in studios and interactive installations. My approach has always been to fuse art and creativity with technology, using cutting edge DSP software and hardware to create sonic experiences in the various environments I have worked in.

With a Bachelor's degree in Cultures and Human Rights and another in Electronic Music Composition, I see music as an interdisciplinary field that connects art, science and society. In 2023, I completed the Master's degree in Sound and Music Computing at the Music Technology Group in Barcelona, where I explored the human-AI interface and the potential of machine learning for sound and music generation and analysis.

As a producer, composer and sound designer, my experience spans multiple contexts and artistic environments - from producing live music for bands and ensembles to composing soundscapes for experimental performances and immersive installations. I have created sound designs for film, video and multimedia projects, always driven by a commitment to uncovering the profound connections between auditory perception, artistic expression and technological innovation.

My mission is to bridge art and technology, creating sound and music that resonates deeply with human emotions and values. At the intersection of humanity, technology and cosmic chaos. Music, in this vision, is neither personal nor impersonal; it exists beyond identity, culture or intention - reflecting infinite patterns hidden within apparent disorder. My work is an act of humble listening, translating noise into something universally human and eternally resonant.

oh!theladystone is an indietronica band that fuses analog synths, guitars, and glitchy beats into intimate, cinematic songs. I co-wrote and produced the record, shaping a live setup that lets us resample vocals and guitars in real time while projecting reactive visuals.

Highlights:

- Produced the band’s debut LP, layering modular textures with songwriting-driven arrangements.
- Designed a hybrid live rig featuring Ableton Live, analog pedals, and synchronized visuals.
- Toured independent venues and festivals across Italy and Spain between 2014 and 2019.

Concrete Bologna Elettroacustica is an electro-acoustic and acousmatic collective born in Bologna in 2010.

We want to promote and spread the listening of electronic and electroacoustic music, in its most diverse meanings and nuances, also through self-built and unconventional diffusion systems. We activate cultural paths that tend to restore sound to a fundamental and primary importance in the artistic experience as well as in everyday life. 

During our activity, we have created several projects: HOLO Laptop Ensemble, ORFEO Collettivo Elettroacustico, Immersioni Sonore, Ephemeral. Each project is characterized by their own performative and experimental scope. The contamination and interaction between different media, such as music, audiovisual, plastic and figurative arts, are an integral part of the group's poetics and activity.

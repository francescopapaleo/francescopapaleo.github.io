CHEAP’s international open call brought together 601 artists, 952 submissions, and 209 posters installed throughout Bologna.

I composed the original music for the campaign video, shaping a sonic journey that matches the energy of the selected works and the collective spirit behind the project. The visuals and editing are by Undervilla.

Indigo is a Barcelona-based DJ collective weaving together Italo disco, deep techno, and Latin electronics. We curate club nights focused on community care, inclusive dance floors, and unexpected sonic pairings.

I co-founded the project to experiment with long-form back-to-back sets and surround-style DJ rigs that blur the line between performer and audience. Our events activate independent venues, social centers, and rooftop spaces across the city.
